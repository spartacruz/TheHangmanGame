# The Hangman Game
A Java based Application - The Hangman Game

This app challenge user to guess the word / sentence that already stored in database. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses (10 attempt), then the game is over and the guesser loses.
